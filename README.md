## MS263: Data Analysis Techniques in Marine Science
### Final project timeline

* April 17 - Project description (2 page written document describing scientific question and plan for analysis, no code)
* May 8 - Informal in-class update, project draft (graded only on reproducibility, feedback given on all aspects)
* May 22 - Final project due, presentations (finals week)

### Final project description

##### Project components:
1.	Jupyter notebook (like a paper, but with code)
  * Additional code, like functions, may be located in .py files (optional)
  * See this [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide for tips on formatting markdown cells with headers, links, images and equations. This markdown syntax can also be used to format your README.md file.
2.	Introduction
3.	Description of methods and data sources
4.	List of dependencies (external packages needed to run the code)
5.	Results (including code, figures and descriptions)
6.	Conclusions
7.	Ideas for future work
8. 	References
9.	Git repository
10.	README.md file describes:
  *	Steps needed to run the code on another computer
  *	Data sources
  *	Dependencies
  *	Location of data in repository, or how to access data

##### Submission format:
*	Git repository.
*	PDF of Jupyter notebook submitted via email (a print-friendly version of the notebook can be made by selecting File -> Print Preview). The PDF ensures that your work can still be evaluated, even if it is not reproducible on another machine.
*	Presentation: 15 minutes + time for questions. Same sections as notebook except for code. References do not need to be in separate slide.

##### Grading criteria:
1.	Reproducibility â€“ another person should be able to run your code, and understand how it works [10 points]
  *	Detailed readme file (see above) [4 points]
  *	Jupyter notebook contains all necessary sections (see above) [4 points]
  *	Git repository is organized and does not contain unnecessary files (hint: use a [.gitignore file](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitignore) ) [2 points]
2.	Depth of scientific analysis [10 points]
*	Raw data plotted to show variability in space and/or time [1 points]
*	Visual comparisons show relationships between different variables [2 points]
*	Calculations go beyond raw data (examples: quality control, subsets of data created, variables combined in model calculations) [4 points]
*	Appropriate statistical analysis performed to address hypotheses (note: credit given for identifying correct approach, not statistical significance) [3 points]
3.	Presentation: Professional delivery, uses effective graphics, and does not use unnecessary text. [5 points]
4.	Demonstration that the topic is important (i.e. something that others will care about) [5 points]
5.	Completeness of description of the scientific question being investigated [5 points]
6.	Clarity of writing, logical progression of ideas [5 points]
7.	Proper citation of outside references from peer-reviewed literature [5 points]
8.	Clarity and relevance of information presented in figures [5 points]
